          Hungry for a Snack... try some Seattle Salmon Cookies! 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Pat and his wife wanted to find a way to get their kids to eat healthier. They told their kids no dessert until they eat all their food, but it just didn't work.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While fishing for Chinook salmon one day, Pat was thinking about how much his kids liked cookies, and how much he liked salmon; and that's when Seattle Salmon cookies were born!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Pat and Penelope spent the next 8 months and their life's savings creating the perfect receipe.  The best part is their kids can't get enough!
